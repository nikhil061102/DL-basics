# Addressing Imbalance in Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

Fraud detection is a common problem in machine learning. However, training a model with a dataset containing a significant class imbalance presents challenges. Consider a scenario where there are 10,000 good transactions and only one fraudulent transaction. Even a simple prediction function that always returns "false" can achieve 99% accuracy due to the majority class dominance. This imbalance creates issues in machine learning, but there are strategies to mitigate it.

## Strategies to Tackle Imbalance:

### 1. Under Sampling of Majority Class:

- Randomly select 1,000 samples from the 99,000 good transactions and discard the rest.
- Combine the selected 1,000 samples with the 1,000 fraudulent samples to balance the dataset.
- This approach, however, discards a significant amount of data, which may not be ideal.

### 2. Over Sampling of Minority Class:

- Duplicate the 1,000 fraudulent transactions 99 times to create a dataset of 99,000 transactions.
- Train the machine learning model with the balanced dataset.
- While effective, this method may not be optimal.

### 3. Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique (SMOTE):

- Utilize the SMOTE technique, which generates synthetic samples for the minority class using a k-nearest neighbors algorithm.
- This approach creates synthetic data points to balance the dataset, avoiding data loss.

### 4. Ensemble Learning:

- Divide the majority class (3,000 transactions) into three batches.
- Combine each batch with the 1,000 fraudulent transactions to create three subsets.
- Train three separate models (M1, M2, M3) with these subsets.
- Use majority voting to make predictions based on the outputs of all models.

### 5. Focal Loss:

- Implement a specialized loss function called focal loss, which penalizes the majority class and assigns higher weightage to the minority class.
- Focal loss is particularly effective in addressing class imbalance in object detection tasks.
- For more details on focal loss, refer to this [Medium article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-focal-loss-fixes-the-class-imbalance-problem-in-object-detection-3d2e1c4da8d7#:~:text=Focal%20loss%20is%20very%20useful,is%20simple%20and%20highly%20effective).

## Examples of Imbalanced Datasets:

1. **Customer Churn Prediction:**
   - In stable companies with good service, the churn rate tends to be low.
2. **Device Failures:**
   - Continuous data from IoT devices often results in low failure rates when devices are stable.
3. **Medical Diagnosis:**
   - In a dataset of 10,000 patients, only a small percentage may have cancer, making cancer prediction an example of imbalanced data.
